### Minimalist typing speed test for mechanical keyboard enthusiasts

### About
A simple and minimalistic typing speed test based on Nuxt.js with a material design scheme based around cards and objects

### TODOS
1. Calculating WPM (I am doing 5 char per word but it feels off...) and Accuracy
2. Changing of themes and adding prebuilt themes
3. Word count setting bug -- when the user has completed and clicks on one of the counts, doesn't direct them to a fresh page, but just shows them half completed typing test
